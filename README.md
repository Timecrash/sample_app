# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

It gets a separate repo since it's not strictly an Odin Project...project, and it's by far more complex and professional than the other, smaller projects.
